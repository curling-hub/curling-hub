# Curling Hub

[![CI](https://github.com/curling-hub/curling-hub/actions/workflows/test-cypress.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/curling-hub/curling-hub/actions/workflows/test-build-docker.yml)

## Introduction
The purpose of this web application is to unite non-elite Curling teams under a single score-tracking hub. This hub allows amateur teams all over the U.S. to compete with each other in various categories, with the ultimate goal of selecting contenders for national championships. 

The system works like this: teams register with Curling Hub through our team portal. This includes sharing relevant player attributes such as name, age, gender, etc. They are then able to compete in various different categories. Officials log into their own special portal to record the outcome of qualified games in each of these categories. These outcomes and other statistics are publicly available, meaning any fan can access Curling Hub to keep track of their favorite team. They are also intended to provide a selection criterion for elite-level national competitions.
